# Part 5: A Large Data Set from Scratch
## Theory: You should know ...
We are putting things together we learned in this course, and some other courses together. Specifically, these knowledge elements include:
- Pandas 
    - DataFrame Operations
    - Plotting
- Markdown
    - Express your analytical ideas
    - Explain your analysis
- Basic Descriptive Analysis from QA500
- Analytics Pipeline from BA500

## What you can do in this part
After completing this part, you should be able to:
- Create and lay out a new Jupyter Notebook
- Collaborate with your peers using Git/Github
- Use Pandas to load and manipulate a large dataset
- Use Dataframe operations to analyze the data
- Use Pandas plotting to plot key statistics

## Instructions
0. __Work with your final project group.__ Consider this part as the final tryout for the final projects, in a __much smaller__ scale. You should work with the same group of people as the final project.
1. __Study the data.__ The data is very popular in the machine learning/data analytics domaain. In this part, you need to conduct some descriptive analysis on the data. The analysis should include the basic analysis of your data (so you can have better understanding), and you need to come up with __2__ interesting research questions that you would like to test with the data.
2. __Study the provided notebook.__ Outline your study, including details like where the data came from, the key columns in the dataset, and what research questions you intend to study. Include the next step as a third research question.
3. __Load your data.__ Use a Pandas DataFrame called `source_data` with appropriate column names, data types,  and numerical indexes. Take care to ensure that your data loaded correctly before proceeding. You may want to keep your results separate from your source data, perhaps in a new DataFrame called `results`.
4. __Do an analysis of the data to answer your analytical quesstions.__ You may need to create new columns to answer your analytical question. You should always consider using __visualization__ (plots) to answer your analytical questions. Make sure to include __write up__ for each of your analytical questions.
5. __Provide some discussions toward next steps.__ The next steps should be very relevant to the dataset (and your analytical questions), but might not be feasible because of the time/data/technique constraints.
6. __You may want to discuss 'lessons learned' and 'technical challenges'.__ These parts are __optional__ in this analysis, but are __required__ in your final project.
